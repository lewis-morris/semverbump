init â€“ create a baseline
========================

Record an empty ``chore(release): initialise baseline`` commit so that future runs of bumpwright have a starting point for comparisons. Run this once when first adopting bumpwright or after importing an existing project without prior release commits.

Examples
--------

.. code-block:: console

   bumpwright init
