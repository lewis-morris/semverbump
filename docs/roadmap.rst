Roadmap
=======

The following items outline potential directions for improving
``semverbump``. Contributions and discussion are welcome.

Upcoming analyzers
------------------

* GraphQL schema diffing
* gRPC service interface tracking
* OpenAPI specification comparison

Ecosystem enhancements
----------------------

* Pluggable analyzer API so projects can ship custom rules
* User-defined severity mappings and thresholds
* Machine-readable (JSON) and rich HTML reports
* Official helpers for common CI providers
* Performance work such as caching and incremental diffing

This roadmap is not exhaustive; ideas and feedback can be proposed
