bumpwright documentation
========================

Static public-API diff and heuristics to suggest semantic version bumps.

Bumpwright inspects a project's public API to highlight breaking changes and
recommend the appropriate semantic version increment. It is designed for
library maintainers, continuous integration systems, and release managers who
need a reliable view of how code changes affect downstream consumers.
